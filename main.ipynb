Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

This takes time and is costly, however, and it's a usually a good idea to explore cheaper options first. We can try to search existing data that might be relevant for our purpose. One candidate is the data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. FreeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis."
